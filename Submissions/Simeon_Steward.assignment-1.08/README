rlg327 Version 1.08 4/8/2021
--------Author(s)---------
Simeon Steward simeon@iastate.edu

forked from Jeremy Sheaffer 1.07 solution code.


--------Important----------

Olny a partial implementation of 1.08, as the object display kept on giving me seg faults. I couldn't
find where they were coming from, so I had to make it not display objects. If you look at the code,
you will still find a mostly complete implementation of objects. Colors and monsters from descriptions
work.
--------Usage notes--------
use $make to compile the program

./rlg327 runs the program

--load/-l <filename> loads a file from the working directory
--save/-s <filename> saves a file to the working directory

--load/-l loads HOME/.rlg327/dungeon
--save/-s saves to HOME/.rlg327/dungeon

--rand/-r <seed> creates a new dungeon from the specified seed

--nummon/-n <numMonsters> creates the dungeon with the specified number of monsters up to the maximum amount of space
            in the rooms which the pc is not in
            default is 10
